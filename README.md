### Facial Finetuning: Using Pretrained Image Classification Models to Predict Politicians' Success
This is the repository for the paper "Facial Finetuning: Using Pretrained Image Classification Models to Predict Politicians' Success" by Asbj√∏rn Lindholm, Christian Hjorth, and Julian Schuessler.

The fine-tuned facial trait models are available for download at [NextCloud](https://nx2461.your-storageshare.de/s/4DqMCppze4QSErJ). 

When making use of the models in your research, please cite the associated working paper:
