### Facial Finetuning: Using Pretrained Image Classification Models to Predict Politicians' Success
This is the repository for the paper "Facial Finetuning: Using Pretrained Image Classification Models to Predict Politicians' Success" by Asbj√∏rn Lindholm, Christian Hjorth, and Julian Schuessler.

The repository contains the fine-tuned facial trait models as well as scripts showing how to fine-tune them and use the models. 

Please visit the [Political Science Research and Methods (PSRM) Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi%3A10.7910%2FDVN%2FCH9AXM&version=DRAFT) for data and replication code for graphs and tables in the paper.
 

# Repository content


## Models 
The fine-tuned facial trait models are available for download at https://nx2461.your-storageshare.de/s/4DqMCppze4QSErJ. 

When making use of the models in your research, please cite the associated working paper:
Lindholm, A., Hjorth, C., & Schuessler, J. (2023). Facial Finetuning: Using Pretrained Image Classification Models to Predict Politicians' Success. https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/w6x42.

## Scripts
This folder contains the code for fine-tuning each of the models using images from the [One Million Impressions dataset](https://github.com/jcpeterson/omi).

The script "How_to_use_model.R" shows how to make predictions on your own images.

## Images
This directory contains images from the [One Million Impressions dataset](https://github.com/jcpeterson/omi) divided into training, validation and test subdirectories.
